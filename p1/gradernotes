1. I wrote this code myself, none of it was copied verbatim or discussed with any classmates.

For ideas, I used the following sources:

My own program0 file, and, by extension (the same as my program 0:

Foster's (recommended) inout2.c file.
- For the process of getting each character from the input pointer.

StackOverflow question "How to remove first character from a C-String?"
- Because I had a feeling moving the pointer forward would be the intended method, I had just forgotten how it was
done momentarily.


2. I believe everything works correctly in all test conditions.

Comments:
- I repeated the same line about seeing ungetc() because I am unsure where you will spot check and I wanted to ensure you saw my explanation without re-writing it > 3 times. Thanks!
